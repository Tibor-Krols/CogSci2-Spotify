 and left him 
a little farm in New England
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night
It was as if someone had spread butter
On all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip
Then he put his head in the crux of his arms
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy behind the control board
Streaming beads of light
He saw his daddy behind the control board
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human
The little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out
No, daddy, don't leave me here alone
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you are not human, you are not human
But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm
Nobody there except for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of
A shaman bouquet. Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck, all his limbs
Everything was twisted and he said:
I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast
Take me up quick. take me up, up to the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it
Where I am not human
I am helium raven and this movie is mine
So he cried out as he stretched the sky
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon
Am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
It won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear them now
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships
They were moving in, streams of them
And he put up his hands and he said:
It's me, it's me, I'll give you my eyes, take me up
Oh now please take me up, I'm helium raven
Waiting for you, please take me up, don't leave me here!The son, the sign, the cross, like the shape of a tortured woman
The true shape of a tortured woman, the mother standing
In the doorway letting her sons, no longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet
He's going to run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull, it's gonna come out
Like a black bouquet shining, 
like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer
, take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up up, take me up I'll go up I'm going up I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship. 
Let the ship slide open
We'll go inside of it where we are not human we're not human
Well, there was sand, there were tiles
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface, he saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot, and then he saw raven coming in
And he crawled on his back and he went up up up up up up up

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do that cannot wait

He was the youngest driver there
The crowd roared as they started the race
Round the track they drove at a deadly pace
No-one knows what happened that day
Or how his car over-turned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath they heard him say
Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die

For her Tommy who passed away

Taste and then swallow me
No chasing the devil
Cause you're level if you follow me
For quality, and I make no apology
For linking my thinking with computer technology
'Cause this is like a modern day hymn
For the new church, I search for the truth
I got a hole in my tooth, I'm uncouth, yes sir
I'm from a street university where we
Learn to earn even in times of adversity
And I would find the easy way out of a hard time
Petty crimes, some time but now I'm inclined to find
A fresh direction, kiss me neck, check out the funky section
'Cause this is the part where I start to rip up words
A comfort coming straight from my heart
I'm not a mystic
My views are realistic, simplistic
One special brew I get pissed quick
And get sick so I don't do it no more
I won't find peace of mind
Rolling around on the floor
The point I wanna make is
You can never escape from your fate
The mistake is to take without giving
From within, You wanna know how I'm living?
I'm cool..
I'm looking after myself
And I could never place wealth before my spirit
I feel it's unhealthy
The devil creep around ya, so stealthy stealthy
'Til you get bold, rush the gold
And before you're much older, your soul is sold
And where's it gettin ya?
Competition starts sweating ya
Golddiggers setting you up
Soon be forgetting your existence
Do ya need a for instance
I hafta admire your persistence
In sticking to a game plan
That brings ya pain man
And at the end of the day nothing is gained
So listen to the voice within
I'll see ya later

Pleasure grows in your soulI ain't a Christian, sometimes I feel like dissin' 'em
But listen, I'm just tryin' to tell you, what I know
If you could once relax
Chill to the max, these words on wax
Would cause sweet bells to ring in your soul
If I say God is alive I know you wanna know why
Babies die, food don't grow, why trains smash, planes crash
Situation mash and slam bam your fellow man
Money's in fashion, huh, it ain't rational
Because damn it, he didn't just give us the planet
And its wealth, deep inside your soul he left a piece of himself
The lord is in here. His voice is small
You keep lying and trying
Denying the call From inside
You can't hide responsibility
So decide from today just how it's going to be
Thou shalt have no other god but me
He can set you free, see
But you have to listen
Now who's that false idol
I see you kissing
Money, success and untold wealth, good health
And all you have to do is love yourself
It's a fact you'll attract all the things that you lack
So just chill
And get off the racetrack
And take a pace back, face facts
It's your decision
You don't need eyes to see
You need vision
Continue to view the lord as being separated
And You're living a lie that's been perpetrated

But even sittin' in the garden, one can still get stung
[Verse 1: Maxi Jazz]
Huh, I'm on Lonely Street, age nearly three
Recently mama's cryin' all the time, is it because of me?
Or my younger sister, even dad was weepin' when he kissed her
Face all puffy like a blister, cryin' like he missed her
Since we moved away from the house where we used to play
They say I'll understand one day, but I doubt it
Mama never say nothin' about it
How'd it get to be so crowded? I found it a strain
Everywhere I look I see pain
And I can't escape the feelin' maybe I'm to blame
So, I strain to listen, prayin' for a decision, wishin'
They were kissin', this feels like extradition or exile
Mama finds it hard to smile
So, I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style
She says, ""Child, I'm workin' so there's nothin' you lack""
But she know I want my dad, I want my family back
[Verse 2: Maxi Jazz]
I'm on Lonely Street, age 43
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me
Took offense, took the kids
I wish that was the end
But before she took her leave she took care of my best friend
Workin' all the hours, God send was not the tactic
You see, 'cause after ten years, I'm left with jackdish
Wanted to make the cash quick so I had to work real late
Bad sex, my woman's vex even if I stay awake
And if I'm honest, I had a lickle cake at the office
I was eatin'
We'd do our cheating over coffees
Makin' tea for the bosses
Makin' free with me
And I agree I got sleazy too easily
But I'm 43
This doesn't usually happen to me
Now I'm lonely
I'm wonderin' what my son's doin' today
Suddenly I'm blinkin' like the screen on my computer display
And I'm drinkin', concerned about what's down the track
If I don't get my family back
I want my family back, yeahMm, I want my family back
[Verse 3: Maxi Jazz]
Huh, I'm on Lonely Street, number 53
Boarded up properly
I'll probably get pulled down
Litter all around inside, there's no sound and no light
But yo, it gets busy at night
People creepin'
Derelicts sneakin' into fix
Speakin'
On the way my timbers creakin', roof leakin'
And bricks comin' loose
Knee high in refuse
But even though I'm a slum
I'm still of some use
Huh
There was a time when my walls were decorated
And under my roof children were educated
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed
A crash in the economy robbed me of my family
And no strategy combats negative equity
So, that's it
Like violence it's drastic
I'm freakin' and seekin' to be more than just a house for crack
Somebody bring my family back";Faithless;Bring My Family Back

And now I feel like I'm starless, I'm ready to burn out

I can transcend you and mentally bend you
But I can't handle the shit that I'm into
I have been blinded, I'm always reminded
Of the things I've wanted but I never could find
I am a part of a world that I hate
I wish the end would come faster, my world's a disaster
Can't you see that I'm down and I'm drownin'
And I can't keep my head above my wake

See me, I'm over the edge, farther with every step
See me, I'm down and I get deeper with every breath

I gotta get you out of my blood
I gotta get you out of my scene

But I've really tried hard to get down to words
It's the way I fit into this world
Think I've survived, pushed me to the darker side
Because of life as it was
The life that was yours should've been mine
But I never could take anymore of this
'Cause I'm always gonna get, gonna get down to the floor
It's a cold gun that I kiss
'Cause I cannot break anymore

Show us starving kids through expensive lenses
On a far and distant shore
Of which, when sold, could feed a good few

Bad news, sad news, never no good news

On a Friday night
To my favorite band
I was pushed aside
I said, ""Hey, don't push me
No one pushes me""
When I was face to face
With the woman I admired
And she gave me this look
I could not believe
And the cold stare remained
I wanted to leave
See, I do believe anger
Is offset by sorrow
What you destroy today
You might regret tomorrow
When you're young and defensive
It comes off offensive
And its hard to repay
The tolerance that you've borrowed
The lasting relationship
Sinks right off the pier
Who wears the pants
It's faded but clear
She's your girlfriend
Seems she ain't too fond of me
I guess that that's the way
It was meant to be
There we were just we 3
You, your girlfriend, and me
I've known you forever
You two just met
So easily amused
How fast we forget
And my jealousy
My self-righteous greed
She's a bit like a book
I'm too farsighted to readAnd I wish you the best
I sometimes feel the need
To say ""Remember me""
Yeah, she's your girlfriend
As far as we can see
Does she look at you
The way she looks at me
And here we are, just we 3

Better just let it be

Let's go looking for a Christmas tree
Across the river and through the woods

Such a strong boy, good hiker too
Eight years old, could arm-wrestle you
Fast as a horse and slick as a snake
We'll make it snappy won't be late
In the dimming light
On frozen ground I lay so helpless
No one else in sight
I'm so sure I just won't last much longer
Lost in the snow didn't know where to go
Don't know how to cook or how to sew
Maybe I'll make friends with the deer, who knows
They have problems too with this snow

On frozen ground I lay so helpless

Got separaated don't know how
They went straight and I went around
Thought we'd meet up by that ravine
I'm hoping this is where I was last seen
In the dimming light
On frozen ground I lay so helpless
No one else in sight
I'm so scared I just won't last much longer
Slogging through the snow waist deep
Digging, reaching, looking for me
