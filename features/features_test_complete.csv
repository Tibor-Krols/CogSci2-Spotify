mornin'!\mIt was driving me crazy\mI said to my mom\mI said, ""Hey, mom, what's up with all the sauerkraut?""\mAnd my dear, sweet mother\mShe just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming train\mAnd she leaned right down next to me\mAnd she said, ""It's good for you!""\mAnd then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth\mAnd force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old\mThat's when I swore that someday\mSomeday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place\mWhere the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer\mAnd the towels are oh so fluffy\mWhere the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long\mAnd anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickel\mWacka wacka doodoo yeah!\mWell, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true\mBecause the very next day, a local radio station had this contest\mTo see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in \mLeonard Nimoy\m's butt\mI was off by three, but I still won the grand prize\mThat's right, a first class one-way ticket\m[Chorus]\mTo Albuquerque!\mAlbuquerque!\m[Verse 2]\mOh yeah\mYou know, I'd never been on a real airplane before\mAnd I gotta tell ya, it was really great\mExcept that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor\mAnd the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time\mThe flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts\mAnd the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore\mAnd, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out\mAnd we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside\mAnd the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died\mExcept for me\mYou know why?'Cause I had my tray table up\mAnd my seat back in the full upright position\mHad my tray table up\mAnd my seat back in the full upright position\mHad my tray table up\mAnd my seat back in the full upright position\mAh ha ha ha\mAh ha ha\mAh\mSo I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage\mI crawled on my hands and knees for three full days\mDraggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag\mAnd my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball\mAnd my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel\mBut finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn\mWhere the towels are oh so fluffy\mAnd you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna\mIt's okay, they're clean!\mWell, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C\mAnd I turned on the SpectraVision\mAnd I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow\mThat I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the doorWell now, who could that be?\mI say, ""Who is it?""\mNo answer\m""Who is it?""\mThere's no answer\m""Who is it?""\mThey're not sayin' anything\mSo, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected\mIt's some big fat \mhermaphrodite\m \mwith a Flock of Seagulls haircut\m and only one nostril\mOh man, I hate it when I'm right\mSo anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel\mAnd I'm like, ""Hey, you can't have that!\mThat snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me!""\mAnd he's like, ""Tough.""\mAnd I'm like, ""Give it!""\mAnd he's like, ""Make me.""\mAnd I'm like, ""'kay!""\mSo I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus\mAnd I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows\mAnd I took out his appendix and he gave me a \mcolonic irrigation\mYes, indeed, you better believe it\mAnd somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook\mAnd twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice\mAnd you know what it said?\mI'll tell you what it said\mIt said\m""If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again;\m""If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator\m""If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again;\m""If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator.""\m[Chorus]\mIn Albuquerque\mAlbuquerque\m[Verse 3]\mWell, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel\mBut I made a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest\mI would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice\mBut first, I decided to buy some donuts\mSo I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop\mAnd I walked on up to the guy behind the counter\mAnd he says, ""Yeah, what do ya want?""\mI said, ""You got any glazed donuts?""\mHe said, ""No, we're outta glazed donuts.""\mI said, ""You got any jelly donuts?""\mHe said, ""No, we're outta jelly donuts.""\mI said, ""You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?""\mHe said, ""No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts.""\mI said, ""You got any cinnamon rolls?""\mHe said, ""No, we're outta cinnamon rolls.""\mI said, ""You got any apple fritters?""\mHe said, ""No, we're outta apple fritters.""\mI said, ""You got any bear claws?""\mHe said, ""Wait a minute, I'll go check\m""No, we're outta bear claws.""\mI said, ""Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?""\mHe says, ""All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels""\mI said, ""Okay, I'll take that.""\mSo he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out\mAnd they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over\mOh man, they were just going nuts\mThey were tearin' me apart\mYou know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head\mI believe it went a little something like this...\mDoh!\mGet 'em off me!\mGet 'em off me!\mNo, get 'em off, get 'em off!\mOh, oh God, oh God!\mOh, get 'em off me!\mOh, oh God!\mI ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face\mWavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'\mLike a constipated wiener dog\mAnd as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams\mHer name was Zelda\mShe was a calligraphy enthusiast\m with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches\mI'll never forget the first thing she said to me\mShe said, ""Hey, you've got weasels on your face.""\mThat's when I knew it was true love\mWe were inseparable after that\mAw, we ate together, we bathed together\mWe even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss\mThe world was our burrito\mSo we got married and we bought us a house\mAnd had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and \mSuperfly\mOh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah\mBut then one fateful night, Zelda said to me\mShe said, ""Sweetie pumpkin? \mDo you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?""\mI said, ""Whoa, hold on now, baby, I'm just not ready for that kind of a commitment!""\mSo we broke up and I never saw her again\mBut that's just the way things go\m[Chorus]\mIn Albuquerque\mAlbuquerque\m[Verse 4]\mAnyway, things really started lookin' up for me\mBecause about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream\mThat's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler!\mI even made employee of the month after I put out that grease fire with my face\mAw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that\mI was gettin' a lot of attitude\mOK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot\mTryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil\mWhen I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself\mSo I, I say to him, I say, ""Hey, you want me to help you with that?""\mAnd Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes\m""No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw.""\mSo I did\mAnd then he gets all indignant on me\mHe's like, ""Hey man, I was just being sarcastic!""\mWell, that's just great\mHow was I supposed to know that?\mI'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud\mBesides, now he's got a really cute nickname: ""Torso-Boy""!\mSo what's he complaining about?\mSay, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote\mThis guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days\mWell, I knew what he meant\mBut just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein\mAnd he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over\mAnd I'm like, ""Hey, come on, don'tcha get it?""\mBut he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming\mYou know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation\mMan, some people just can't take a joke, you know?\mAnyway, um, um, where was I?\mKinda lost my train of thought\mUh, well, uh, okay\mAnyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it\mBut I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is:\mI\mHate\mSauerkraut!\mThat's all I'm really tryin' to say\mAnd, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up\mAnd find yourself in an existential quandary​\mFull of loathing and self-doubt\mAnd wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence\mAt least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that\mSomewhere out there in this crazy
