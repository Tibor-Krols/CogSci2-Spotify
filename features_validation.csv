When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our \mnew birds\mShe said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out\mBut you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week\mYou can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on.

hell's kitchen\mTrying to listen in or eavesdrop from some another dimension\mIt was self-serving just like this is\mConveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas\mThe television went from being a babysitter to a mistress\mTechnology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance\m'til we just stayed distant and never touched\mNow all we do is text too much\mI don't

goose was cooked\mStick a fork in me\mThe jig is up\mI blew my chances, the rest is history, our future was torn asunder\mIt became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer\mAt least I didn't include my name\mThankfully I wrote the whole note in code and it had 10 layers\mOf scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open\mPlus, it was set to self destruct\mWhoever read it probably died... laughing\mI wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened\mA year later, I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her\mI had someone else to obsess over\mI was older\mAnd I was very mature\mI forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph\mCause I was failing math\mDisconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my homeI checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road\mSteamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode\mIf you snoop around long enough for something in particular\mYou're guaranteed to find it\mFor better or worse that's how I learned\mThat it's best to just keep some things private\mIt was the best of times\mIt was the end of times\mIt was the best of times\mIt was the end of times\mI was always on deck, I was next in line\mAn only child with a pen and pad\mWriting a list of things that I could never have\mThe walls in my house were paper-thin\mEvery squabble seemed to get deafening\mIf my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things\mProbably to keep from being embarrassed\mNever meant to upset or give grief to my parents\mKept my secrets... hid my talents...\mIn my head, never under the mattress\mTherapy couldn't break me\mNever learned a word that would ensure safety\mSo I spoke softly and I tiptoed often\mThe door to my room was like a big old coffin\mThe way that it creaked when I closed it shut\mAnxieties peaked when it opened up\mAs if everything that I was thinking would be exposed\mI still sleep fully clothed\mIt was the best of timesIt was beautiful\mIt was brutal\mIt was cruel\mIt was business as usual\mHeaven\mIt was hell\mUsed to wonder if I'd live to see 12\mWhen I did I figured that I was immortal\mLoved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal\mCouldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend bust a move with any other dudes\mTone Loc was talking bout a ""Wild Thang"" but I was still caught up in some child thangs\mScared of a God who couldn't spare the rod\mIt was clearly a brimstone and fire thang\mPyromaniac\mKleptomaniac\mCouldn't explain my desire to steal that fire\mNow I add it to my rider\mLike ""Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!""\m It was the best of times\mIt was the end of times\mThe school counselor was clueless cause I never skipped classes\mPerfect attendance\mImperfect accent\mSpeech impediment they could never really fix and I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses\mConsidered doing something that would cripple me\mI wanted a wheelchair\mI wanted the sympathy\mI wanted straight teeth so then came braces\m4 years of headgear helped me change faces\mIt was the best of times\mIt was the end of times\mNow I wonder if I'll live to see marriage\mWonder if I'll live long enough to have kids\mWonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids\mIf I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is\m""Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years\mDon't let anybody protect your ears\mIt's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear\mIt's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers\mBeer won't give you chest hair\mSpicy food won't make it curl\mWhen you think you've got it all figured out and then everything collapses\mTrust me, kid\mIt's not the end of the world."""
