Gently, hold our heads on high
Aimless time, in fear now hide

This is the dawning of a new age
A heart that beats the wrong way

Gently, hold our heads on high

A touch of silence, the violence of dark
Illusion span, the aroma of time

Infinite fall of instinct
Order of one spells deceit
Infinite lack of trust
Order of one obsolete
Oh, escaping time is all we lost ahead
When it's found, can judgment make amends?
From force-fed impressions let us mortify the mind
Each soul to violate, each instinct to be rendered false
Torn asunder be the conventional forms and frames
Now for the blood of heaven unlearn
…And the cleansing comes
Felt a tremor in the pillars of the senses
Cursed victim of a distance near
The first dream, the clearest vision
Aimlessly steer towards our night
We belong to thee
Oh, dearest bliss, unnerving silence
Entangled withinDimly begotten, in clarity found
Virgin-like tears for impurity bound
Search he, who darken the stars and the sky
Greet now this vision an emerald dawn
Empty the Sun, carve out the wind
Insanity's crescendo, tear out the blinded eye
Insanity's crescendo!
Lament of thunder, take comfort in fear
Lightning veins in crude exterior
Voice the oppression, voice the hypocrisy
Lay down the law that made instinct fall
Escape now and revert the cleansing rebirth
Torn asunder be
Affect me not on darkened vision
Insanity's crescendo
Grimly threat, the footstep's torn
Rebellic stand, the seeker tall
Turn of insanity's hand
Take this darkened vision from my sight
Nailed to the image of ignorance

He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow

There was a cat that really was gone

It was a shame how he carried on
[Verse 2]
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the Queen, he was no wheeler-dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son[Chorus]

Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us,"" they kept demanding
And he really came[Chorus]

They put some poison into his wine

And she takes another step
Slowly she opens the door

Pick up all the broken glass and furniture on the floor
Been up half the night screaming now it's time to get away
Pack up the kids in the car

Another alibi to write

Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

And there are children to think of
Babies asleep in the backseat
Wonder how they'll ever make it through this living nightmare
But the mind is an amazing thing
Full of candy dreams and new toys and another cheap hotel
Two beds and a coffee machine
But there are groceries to buy
And she knows she'll have to go home

Another stop sign

Another lonely highway in the black of night
But there's hope in the darkness
